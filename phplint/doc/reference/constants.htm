<h2>Constants</h2>




<h3>The define() statement</h3>


<p>
The legacy PHP statement <code>define()</code> allows to define constants,
that is symbolic names whose value is defined once for all and cannot
be changed later. The first argument of this function is the name of
the constant provided as a string; the second argument is its value.
For example:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><code>define("LIB_BASE_PATH", __DIR__ . "/../lib");</code></div>

<p>
The <b>name</b> of the constant can be any expression of type
string, but typically it is simply a literal string like in our example.
PHPLint raises an error if the name cannot be evaluated statically, so
it cannot contain variables nor functions, and raises an error if the resulting
name of the constant is not a valid identifier.  Valid identifiers are those
composed of letters, digits and the underscore "<code>_</code>"; the first
character cannot be a digit. The name of a constant is case-sensitive,
so "<code>Pi</code>" and "<code>pi</code>" are different names.
</p>

<p>The name of a constant cannot be a PHP nor a PHPLint keyword, so names as TRUE, true, function, Function, mixed, MIXED, etc. are forbidden.</p>

<p>
For the <b>value</b> fot eh constant, although PHP allows any type, PHPLint applies the same restriction of the <tt>const</tt> statement and pretends the expression be evaluable statically: a <b>boolean</b>, an <b>int</b>, a <b>float</b> or a <b>string</b>; arrays are allowed in PHP 7.
</p>

<p>
The special <code>NULL</code> value and the <code>NULL</code> string are allowed, for example:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><code>
define("UNDEFINED_VALUE", NULL);<br>
define("DEFAULT_NAME", /*. (string) .*/ NULL);
</code></div>

<p>
A constant cannot be re-defined.
</p>

<p>
A constant can be defined inside a function, but PHPLint raises an error
because it cannot ensure the correct usage of its definition: the constant
might be used before the function defining it be called, or the function
might be called more than once causing a run-time error from the PHP
interpreter. So, the only remaining place where global constants can be
declared is the global scope of the package.
</p>

<p>
A constant not intended to be exported to others packages should
be declared as "private" to the package where it is defined. To this
end, PHPLint provides a specific meta-code word:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><code>/*. private .*/ define("MAX_USERS", 20);</code></div>

<p>
A private constant cannot be re-defined nor it can be used in any other
package importing this package.  Private constants are reported by
the PHPLint Documentator into the list of the <b>Private items</b> of
the package, since they still occupy their position in the global name-space.
</p>

<p>The <tt>define()</tt> statement has a third optional argument of boolean type; by setting TRUE there, the name of the constant becomes case-insensitive under PHP. PHPLint does not allows this third argument and gives error if it is present; <b>constants are always case-sensitive under PHPLint.</b> However, despite this case-sensitiveness, for compatibility with existing PHP programs, constants that differs only by their upper- or lower-case letters are signaled as error.</p>





<h3>The const statement</h3>

<p>
This statement is available since PHP 5.3 and allows to define one or more
constants:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
const MAX_CONNECTED_USERS = 10,
      MAX_USER_NAME_LENGTH = 20,
      ADMIN_ROLE_NAME = "Admin";
</pre></div>

<p>
This statement can occur only at global scope, and the expression must be
static (no simple expressions allowed as in the <code>define()</code>
statement). Constants so defined are added to the current namespace.
</p>

<p>
	The <code>/*.private.*/</code> PHPLint meta-code modifier (PHP 5) or the <tt>private</tt> PHP modifier (PHP 7) can be prepended to the
<code>const</code> keyword, and it is intended to mark constants that are
private to the package and cannot be used outside, not even in the same
namespace.
